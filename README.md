# Pandas.NET
Pandas port in C#, translate Python Machine Learning code in One - One function mapping.

Pandas.NET is based on [NumSharp](https://github.com/Oceania2018/NumSharp) project.

### How to use

```
var np = new NumPy();
var pd = new Pandas();
```

```
// init from ndarray generated by numpy
var se = pd.Series(np.random.randn(5), new Index("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"));
// access by array index or Series Index
Assert.AreEqual(se[4], se["e"]);
            
// Series can be instantiated from anonymous object
se = pd.Series(new { b = 1, a = 0, c = 2 });
```

Pandas.NET is a member project of [SciSharp.org](https://github.com/SciSharp) which is the .NET based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.
